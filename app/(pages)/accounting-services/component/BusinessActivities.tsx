                The UAE has its own set of GAAP accounting principles. The
                International Federation of Accountants (IFAC) is in charge of
                maintaining these standards. The GAAP principles apply to all
                the UAE government entities and state-owned companies.

                  The accounting standards of the UAE are based on the following

                <li className="mb-4">
                  Income is recognised when it is realised or realisable.
                  Expenses are recognised when they are incurred. Revenue is
                  recognised when it is earned.
                </li>
                <li className="mb-4">
                  You should measure assets and liabilities at fair value,
                  except for financial instruments and leases. These are
                  measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rates.

                keeping records for ten years to prove tax compliance.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Bookkeeping is one of the most critical aspects of an
                organisation. It is the documentation of financial transactions
                and records. Accounting and bookkeeping are tedious and complex
                jobs.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                There are several reasons behind this complexity.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The accountant has many responsibilities to fulfil. They need to
                ensure all transactions are documented and accounted for. This
                can be overwhelming when the company has a lot of transactions
                taking place.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                There are many types of documents that need to be maintained.
                These include cash receipts, bank statements, and cheque stubs.
                The accountant needs to ensure that all these documents are
                stored safely, and the information is easily accessible.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                It will require more than 60 hours per week to manage your
                accounting. This draws your attention from other business
                operations like customer service, partnerships, and others.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Outsourcing your accounting operations frees up time for other
                operations. It allows you to focus on important business
                operations.

                Have you ever opened your mail to find a letter from the taxman?
                The reason behind this letter is that you may not have filed
                your taxes.

                The UAE has introduced VAT in 2018 and is planning to introduce
                corporate tax in 2023. It is best to make sure your company’s
                books are in order and updated to prepare for any tax audit or
                reporting requirements. This can help you ensure your business
                complies with the country’s tax regulations, among other
                corporate requirements.

                <li>

                Accounting outsourcing companies have the experience to help
                your business avoid legal issues. They are well informed of UAE

                legal standards and advise on minimising legal risks.

                Talent is the lifeblood of a successful company. You need
                professionals to meet your accounting needs. Businesses in the
                UAE have been facing a shortage of skilled workers for years.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Dubai is now specifically facing a shortage of accounting staff.
                The problem stems from the increased competition for employees.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Employers have a hard time finding the best candidates for their
                vacancies. When they do, it’s difficult to retain them. Despite
                government policies to help retain accounting staff, it
                continues to be hard.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                For instance, the government requires an accountant to work for
                at least two years before they can resign. If he quits before
                that time, he pays back the salary and benefits.
