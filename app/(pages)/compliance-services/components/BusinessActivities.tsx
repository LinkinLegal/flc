              <p className="mb-6">
                Business compliance is the process of ensuring that your
                business practices are in line with the law. This includes
                making sure that you are aware of all the relevant laws and
                regulations, and taking steps to ensure that you are compliant
                with them.

                If you’re running a business in the UAE, then you must have a

                UAE has several complex laws and regulations, and if you’re not
                compliant with them, you could face serious penalties.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Penalties in the UAE can be much stricter than in other

                What Do I Need to Know About Business Compliance Services in
                UAE?
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                There are many things you should know about business compliance
                services in the UAE. The first thing is that there is no single
                standard for business compliance services, so it’s important to
                make sure the service you choose is right for your business.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Important questions to ask a potential compliance expert in
                Dubai should include:
                <li>What services do you offer?</li>
                <li>
                  Are you familiar with the laws and regulations in the UAE?
                </li>
                <li>
                  How often do you update your clients on changes to the law?
                </li>
                <li>
                  Do you have any case studies or success stories from previous
                  clients?
                </li>
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                These questions will help you determine whether a particular
                compliance service is right for your business.

                Business Compliance Issues
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Noncompliant business practices can lead to legal trouble,
                fines, and even jail time. It is therefore crucial that a
                business complies with the law at all times.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Some examples of noncompliance with Dubai law are as follows:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc pl-5 mb-4">
                <li>Operating without a valid trade licence</li>
                <li>
                  Not registering employees with the Ministry of Human Resources
                  and Emiratisation (MOHRE)
                </li>
                <li>Trading in banned goods or services</li>
                <li>Failing to pay taxes</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">These are just a few examples.</p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the UAE banned goods could include things like alcohol and
                pork products, as well as weapons or drugs. It would be a shame
                if a business was in legal hot water for serving alcohol at a
                work reception or some ham sandwiches, but it could technically
                happen!
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Dubai is an emirate within the United Arab Emirates (UAE). As
                such, it has its laws and regulations that are separate from
                those of other emirates in the UAE.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary  mt-8">
                Operating Without a Valid Trade Licence
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Not registering employees with the Ministry of Human Resources
                and Emiratisation (MOHRE) is a common mistake made by businesses
                in Dubai.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                All employees must be registered with MOHRE, regardless of their
                nationality or visa status.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The penalties for violating these laws can be quite severe. For
                example, operating without a valid trade licence can lead to a
                fine of up to AED200,000 and/or imprisonment for up to two
                years. A 250 AED fine may also be imposed if a trade licence is
                not renewed.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-3xl font-bold text-primary  mt-8">
                Trading in banned goods or services is another common offence,
                and it can result in hefty fines.
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                It’s important to be aware of what goods and services are banned
                to avoid any penalties. Some items, like alcohol and pork, might
                surprise you.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In 2020, several old laws were decriminalised, including
                drinking alcohol without a licence. Alcohol, on the other hand,
                may still only be consumed in private homes and licensed public
                locations. In the UAE, to drink legally, a person must be at
                least 21 years old.
              </p>
              So, to trade alcohol, your business should still be fully
              licensed, even though rules about drinking have somewhat relaxed.

                Failing to Pay Corporate Taxes
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Failing to comply with the UAE’s corporate tax laws can result
                in severe penalties, including imprisonment for up to six months
                and/or a fine of AED 100,000.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As of 1 June 2023, the UAE has introduced a federal corporate
                tax of 9% on taxable profits exceeding AED 375,000. Businesses
                operating in Free Zones may still qualify for tax exemptions if
                they meet specific criteria.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                It’s essential to stay compliant with these regulations to avoid
                penalties.

                Whilst most banks will have a mobile banking function to help

                If you’re planning to use your bank account to do business in
                the UAE, you’ll need to open a corporate bank account. The
                reason why you have to open a corporate account is that UAE law
                prohibits you from doing business with a personal account.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Generally speaking, corporate accounts should be current
                accounts. The reason for this is so that they can process a
                large volume of transactions. Opening a current corporate
                account in the UAE usually takes between two and four weeks.

                When you go to open a corporate bank account, it’s important to

                exact documents may vary depending on your chosen bank and your
                type of company, but they usually include:

                The good news is that roughly 85% of the UAE’s population are
