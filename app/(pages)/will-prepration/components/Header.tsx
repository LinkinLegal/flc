          Our experts will help you understand the type of will options
          available and which one is right for you. DIFC provides a common law
          environment for non-Muslims to draw up a will in English to determine
          how their assets should be distributed if they pass away. All seven
          emirates in the UAE are covered by DIFC Wills, which ensure
          non-Muslimsâ€™ estates are not subject to the UAE Shariah law. The
          assets can include real estate, cash, possessions, company shares,
          bank and brokerage accounts and more.
