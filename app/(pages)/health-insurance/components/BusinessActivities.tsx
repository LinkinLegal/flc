                Did you know Dubai has one of the most efficient healthcare
                systems in the world? According to a study, there are at least
                181 doctors per 100,000 residents in this city. This has led to
                an increase in medical tourism and made Dubai one of the most
                renowned destinations in the world.

                The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has a well-developed health
                infrastructure with high healthcare standards. This includes
                easily accessible modern health facilities and health insurance
                plans. Health insurance in Dubai is available to both locals and
                visitors.

                Health Insurance Requirements in Dubai
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Health insurance requirements and facilities in the UAE vary
                from one city to another. However, regardless of the city you
                are in, you can be sure to receive world-class healthcare. For
                example, in Abu Dhabi, the citizens are covered under the Thiga
                program, which gives them full access to various public and
                private healthcare providers.

                The UAE has an all-inclusive government-funded health service
                that delivers high-quality standards of care in both public and
                private sectors. These services are available for free or
                subsidised for UAE nationals.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                However, ex-pats and any other non-resident have to pay to
                access the high standards of care. If you are an employee in the
                UAE, your employer is responsible for ensuring you can access
                quality healthcare.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Additionally, all employers, including employers of ex-pats in
                the UAE, cannot deduct the salary of their employees to provide
                them with good medical coverage. Also, sponsors have to provide
                health insurance for their dependents.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In Dubai, the Health Insurance law requires all residents to
                have valid insurance coverage that exceeds or meets the minimum
                requirement laid out by the Dubai Health Authority (DHA).

                UAE nationals in Dubai can access Saada, which provides health

                government health programs in Dubai. Citizens who use Saada cab
                access treatment in various private healthcare providers and DHA

              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The citizens can also opt out of other private healthcare

                How Healthcare Works in the UAE
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Though the healthcare system in all emirates is straightforward,
                there are some things that you should be aware of. Dubai health
                insurances coverage for employees and their dependents is
                determined by their designation and salary. This means that the
                type of policy you choose or the extent of coverage will
                determine the cost of your medical services.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Employers and sponsors in Abu Dhabi need to provide health
                insurance coverage for their employees and their dependents.
                This includes one spouse and up to three children under 18
                years.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                {" "}
                On the other hand, employers in Dubai only provide health
                insurance coverage for their employees. Sponsors are required to
                provide insurance cover for their resident dependents.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Here are some of the healthcare insurance options in Dubai.

                Private Health Insurance in Dubai
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you are a non-resident in Dubai, your sponsor or employer
                must ensure you have valid health insurance. However, not all
                jobs provide health insurance coverage. The coverage for your
                dependents may also depend on the options you want, including
                special treatments and their age.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Note that every private health insurance provider works
                differently. Therefore before choosing an insurer, it is vital
                to know how they work, how to claim, treatment included in your
                coverage, how to pay, and more.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Check out the UAE Insurance Authority for a list of all approved
                and registered insurance providers. Ensure you get health
                coverage from a valid insurance company. It is important to note
                that if you seek residence in Dubai or any other city in the
                UAE, the government will require you to prove that you have
                valid health coverage.

                Advantages of Private Health Insurance
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                One of the most significant benefits of having private health
                insurance in Dubai is avoiding a monthly fine. Living without
                health insurance in the UAE attracts a fine. This fine can
                exceed your monthly insurance healthcare contributions.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Additionally, private health insurance gives you access to some
                of the first-class medical facilities in the nation. These
                facilities are well equipped with modern health equipment and
                staffed by experts who speak English as their first language.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Moreover, the insurance allows you to personalise your coverage
                and include add-ons or special requirements.

                Public health coverage in the UAE varies from one emirate to
                another. It mainly covers emergencies, preventive services such
                as immunisation for newborns and children, and crucial
                vaccinations and maternity services.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The insurance also includes primary health care services such

                dental and gum exams. The healthcare cover can apply to surgical

              </h3>

                Dubai has an Essential Benefits Plan (EBP), which provides
                medical coverage to people who earn very low salaries. This plan
                is mainly for residents who make below AED 4,000. It also covers

              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The EBP plan has a fixed cost of AED550-AED650 annually and
                covers maternity, medication, tests, surgeries, emergencies, and
                outpatient and inpatient treatments. This cover also has some
                limitations such as:

                <li>An annual cap of AED 1,000 for inpatient services</li>
                <li>
                  An annual limit of AED 1,500 for medicine or prescription
                </li>
                <li>A 30% co-pay for every prescription</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The plan covers maternity women’s healthcare, including
                outpatient antenatal services and inpatient services at birth.
                This includes up to AED 7,000 for a vaginal birth delivery and
                up to and up to AED 10,000 for a medically necessary caesarian
                section.

              <p className="mb-4">
                Additionally, a mother’s EBP plan includes 30 days of coverage
                for a newborn child. This covers screenings and tests. It is
                important to note that the UAE government only allows some
                insurance companies to provide EBP.
              </p>

                Remember, EBP is only available to employees who earn below
                4,000 AED per month. However, it provides the same coverage as
                public healthcare insurance coverage. If you are a domestic
                worker, your employer should provide you with healthcare.

                Having health insurance in Dubai is very vital. You cannot get a
