        What Is the Golden Visa in the UAE?
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Unlike many other international Visa programs, the United Arab Emirates’
        unique Golden Visa program allows eligible individuals permanent
        residence with a 10 year visa. However, it also comes with a range of
        attractive privileges that most typical residence visa programs would
        not offer.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Launched in 2019, the famous Golden Visa program functioned as a bid to
        attract and retain foreign talent with permanent residence in a
        tax-friendly environment. The program also aimed to foster business
        development to boost the UAE’s economy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">It worked.</p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        By late 2021, 44,000 Dubai residents had secured long-term residency
        through the Golden Visa. The program may also form part of the reason
        the UAE fared so well through the pandemic. The program has certainly
        bolstered the UAE’s global standing as an attractive place to live, work
        and kickstart new businesses.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        The Golden Visa program specifically aims to attract budding
        entrepreneurs, investors and talented individuals in specific fields.
        Medical staff, engineers, researchers and even high-achieving university
        students can be eligible for the program.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Golden Visa Residency is applicable for ten years. In some situations,
        the visas can also be renewed automatically – a handy feature for those
        who struggle with the endless monotony of bureaucracy. Features like
        this prove that the UAE government wants to make the visa application
        process simple. Anyone who’s ever applied for a foreign visa will know
        how painful these processes can sometimes be.

        Benefits of a UAE Golden Visa
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        As its name suggests, the Golden Visa program is the gold standard of
        long-term residence visas. The UAE government has worked hard to ensure
        the program has enough perks to attract the best of the best from around
        the globe. Although, the year-round sunshine, ultra-modern
        infrastructure and stunning beaches couldn’t hurt.

          <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold">You Don’t Need a Local Sponsor</h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Golden Visa holders do not need to obtain a local sponsor to live,
            study and work in the UAE.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            To those unfamiliar with common residency processes around the
            world, this may not sound like a big deal. However, those who are
            familiar will know how time-consuming and complex obtaining a local
            sponsor can be. This complexity is often compounded if you aren’t
            employed by a local company or you don’t know any nationals from the
            country in which you are trying to secure a residence visa.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Not needing a national sponsor to obtain a Golden Visa takes a large
            degree of complexity out of applying for residency in the UAE. All
            the more reason to apply!

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Another major benefit of the Golden Visa is that visa holders can
            own 100% of a business operating out of the UAE.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">This is a big deal.</p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            Before the introduction of the Golden Visa program, foreigners
            seeking to start a business in the UAE needed to partner with an
            Emirati national, who will own a percentage of the company. There
            were exceptions for certain industries located in specific zones.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            The Golden Visa removes these logistical barriers for eligible
            foreign entrepreneurs, business owners and investors.

          </h2>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you secure a visa through the UAE’s Golden Visa program, you do
            not need to go through all the hassle of obtaining visas for your
            family members or key businesses associates. If you obtain a Golden
            Visa, you can add your family members to it. You can also add
            business partners or associates to the visa, subject to some
            specific conditions.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">
            If you have a partner or kids travelling with you to the UAE, this
            particular feature of the Golden Visa program could save you a lot
            of paperwork. It could also prevent your family from being
            separated.

        However, it’s worth noting that the goal of the Golden Visa program is
        to foster business development. The UAE government is seeking people of

        As such, the criteria for the Golden Visa is still highly specific.
