                Why Should You Consider Starting a Business in Dubai?

                There are several reasons to start a business in Dubai including
                the funding initiatives by the government to accelerate business
                growth and its vibrant economy. But if you talk to anybody, the
                tax benefits are probably at the top of their list.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Middle East still has zero tax on personal and corporate
                income. The only thing you need to pay is the value-added tax at
                a low rate of 5%.

              <p className="mb-4">
                You can set up in a free zone which means you pay 0% corporate

                to repatriate 100% of the profits from the business.

                What Does Value-Added Tax Mean?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Value-added tax, or VAT, is a tax based on consumption. Unlike
                taxes levied on income, VAT applies to purchases of goods and
                services. It’s added to every point in the manufacturing and
                distribution process where the business added value to the
                product.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The tax is paid by the consumer. The business collects the tax
                It’s generally paid by the customer on any purchases. The
                business must collect the VAT and remit it to the government.
                Not doing so can lead to penalties or even criminal charges.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                VAT is the most common type of consumption tax. Over 150
                countries, including European Union members, Canada and New
                Zealand, have implemented VAT.

                History of VAT
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                VAT only came to Dubai in 2018. It applies to all online
                purchases and traditional store purchases received in Dubai.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As of January 1, 2018, the UAE required businesses to register
                for VAT. They were required to collect and remit the amounts to
                the government. It’s the first time that there has been a VAT in
                the Middle East.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Federal Tax Authority (FTA) was established to manage and
                collect federal taxes. VAT was implemented to provide a new
                source of income to help the government provide different
                services, including hospitals, parks and waste control. The
                vision behind implementing VAT was to reduce its dependence on
                income derived from oil.

                7 Things to Know About VAT in Dubai

                The reality is that there are several steps you need to take
                before starting a business in Dubai. You want to make sure you
                get your business formation right from the start. This can save
                you a lot of trouble in the future.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                One of the most important considerations is understanding your
                VAT obligations, registering as needed, and paying your VAT on
                time. Without knowing your obligation, you can end up paying a
                significant amount of penalties for any interest. Interest can
                increase up to 300% of any unpaid VAT liability.

                    The first thing you need to know is that the VAT in Dubai
                    applies at a flat rate of 5%. It applies to all taxable
                    supplies of goods and services including imports. Some
                    services are exempt, so you need to find out whether you
                    have a taxable supply.{" "}

                      {" "}

                      consideration from a person conducting business in Dubai.
                      This includes all retail businesses, food at restaurants
                      and hotels and other entertainment activities. Any
                      business that you’re thinking of starting would likely be
                      considered a taxable supply.{" "}

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If you’re wondering whether the 5% VAT applies to you, you
                    first need to determine whether any of your supplies are 0%
                    VAT or exempt supplies.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Even if you have a taxable supply, certain services have a
                    0% VAT rate. These businesses must include zero value in
                    their invoices.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The 0% VAT applies to goods and services that are exported
                    outside the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states.
                    GCC member states include Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar,
                    Saudi and the UAE.

                    Zero-rated VAT also applies to international transportation

                    investment-grade precious metals such as silver and gold
                    with 99% purity. Certain areas like health care and

                    Zero VAT is different from exempt VAT. If you are providing
                    a zero-rated taxable supply, you still have to register for
                    VAT with the government. You also have to provide an
                    invoice, but you will charge 0% VAT.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Unlike zero-rated services where businesses have to charge
                    0% VAT, exempt services are completely exempt from VAT.
                    There are only 4 items that are exempt from VAT, including
                    financial services, supply of residential property, vacant

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Financial services are generally exempt from VAT. Financial
                    services are those services that are connected to dealing
                    with money. This can include exchanging currency, providing

                    Providing insurance contracts also falls within exempt

                    The supply of residential buildings is exempt from VAT,

                    ground and can be moved are not considered residential
                    buildings, including RVs, motor homes, etc. Hotels and

                    Exempt services include any local transport by way of land,

                    business that transports locally, you should look into
                    whether the services are exempt. Even a helicopter or

                    As a business, you will charge your customers VAT. But
                    you’ll also have to pay VAT on certain goods and services

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Your total VAT liability is the total amount of VAT you
                    collected from customers less the Input Tax. Input tax is
                    the amount of money paid by the business when purchasing
                    certain goods. You can recover any tax paid on inputs.

                    For example, a business can buy 10 computer tablets from a

                    They’ll pay 5% VAT on the purchase. The customer will also
                    pay 5% VAT.

                    first purchase. At the end of the day, VAT is only charged
                    once to the end-user.

                    process from the FTA’s portal. Enter all the information and
                    attach the documents. You’ll need to provide contact and
                    banking details.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Once the FTA approves your application, they will give you a
                    unique Tax Registration Number. You can use that to sign in
                    to your VAT portal.

                    You’re obligated to keep track of your taxable supplies.
                    Make sure all your information is up to date. The minute
                    you’re over the minimum threshold, you’ll be obligated to
                    register. You don’t want to be over the limit and not
                    realize that you have VAT obligations.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    You must file your VAT return with the FTA online within 28
                    days from the end of the “tax period”. A tax period depends
                    on your annual turnover. If you have an annual turnover
                    below AED 150 million, you need to file your VAT returns
                    monthly.
                  </p>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Larger businesses with an annual turnover of over AED 150
                    million must file their returns monthly. This threshold
                    ensures that the business makes its VAT payment monthly
                    without creating delays or confusion. These larger amounts
                    of VAT payments are better dealt with monthly.

                A company may outsource their accounting because they don’t have
                the staff to handle these tasks. Whatever the reason, it can be
                a more cost-effective alternative than hiring permanent
                employees.

                7. You Can Pay Online
              </h3>

              <p className="mb-4">
                At the end of each tax period, you must submit a VAT return to
                the FTA online. This is basically a summary of the total taxable
                supplies you’ve made in that period. It also shows how much VAT
                you should have collected and now need to pay to the government.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You need to file VAT returns and pay any VAT owing every
                quarter, by the 28th of the subsequent month. Late filing
                returns can result in penalties. Missing the deadline means that
                you will be subject to a penalty of AED 1,000 for the first
                time, and AED 2,000 for every other instance of late filing.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The penalty for late payment can be significant. It’s 2% of the
                unpaid VAT amount for the first 7 days, and 4% after the first 7
                days. If you don’t pay the VAT amount in a month, you will have
                to pay a penalty of 1% per day until it reaches 300% of the
                unpaid VAT amount.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Even if you have a zero-rated supply, you still have to file
                your VAT returns. If you don’t, you will be subject to the same
                late-filing penalties.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You can have VAT payable or VAT owing. If you have VAT owing,
                you can pay online through the official FTA website. You can pay
                by credit card, eDebit or bank transfer. The bank transfer can
                be local or international.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Paying your VAT should not be difficult. You want to make sure
                you pay the amounts on time. The flexibility of the payments
                allows you to pay your VAT easily and conveniently.
