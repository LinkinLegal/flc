                One-Year Remote Working Visa
              </h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Last year, the UAE adopted a remote working visa program. This
                allows digital nomads working from home as a result of the
                pandemic to do so from the UAE.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Both foreign employees and foreign business owners can apply. In
                theory, this visa is open to passport holders from all
                countries.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Prior to the introduction of this visa program, you would have
                needed to be sponsored by an Emirati national or obtain work in
                the UAE to spend such an extended time in the country. This visa
                removes those barriers, opening up the UAE to a much larger
                population of foreign workers.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Unfortunately, this visa program does not allow you to establish
                a business in the UAE. As such, if your goal is to establish a
                business in the country, the one-year remote working visa may
                not be for you.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                However, if you want an extended taste of life in the UAE prior
                to making a decision about whether to locate your business
                there, this visa could be a good option.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Spending a year building business relationships while working
                your day job remotely may not be such a bad idea. In fact, it
                could be a great start to your new life as an entrepreneur in
                the UAE.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The remote-working visa application will set you back USD 287.
                There are other costs involved, including UAE health insurance
                and ID fees. These costs may vary. In total, however, you are
                likely to spend upwards of USD 600.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                To apply for this visa, you’ll need a passport with no less than
                six months validity and UAE health insurance.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Employees will also need to present the following:

              <ul className="list-disc list-inside mb-4">
                <li>Proof of employment</li>

                <li>Three months bank statements</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Business owners will also need to present the following:

                <li>Proof of business ownership of no less than one year</li>
                <li>
                  An average monthly income of no less than USD 5000/month

                Golden Visa program do not need a national sponsor. Successful
                applicants can travel freely to and from the UAE and add family
                members and executives to the visa.

                Dubai Immigration Procedures
              </h3>
              <p>
                Assuming you’ve prepared all the necessary visas and
                documentation, the Dubai airport immigration process is
                incredibly streamlined. Like Dubai’s architecture, this process
                relies on state-of-the-art technology and innovation.
              </p>
              <p>
                Instead of being greeted by border patrol staff on arrival,
                you’ll pass through an electronic gate. These e-gates allow you
                to register your identity and present your passport and
                documentation. The e-gate will also scan your retina.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-4">
                While unlikely, you may be selected for random screening. If
                this occurs, you’ll need to present evidence of your visa. A
                charge of AED 30 may apply if you do not have a hard copy of
                your visa confirmation number.
